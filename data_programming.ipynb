    "This notebook provides an overview of the __data programming__ model pioneered by [Ratner et al. 2016](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6523-data-programming-creating-large-training-sets-quickly):\n",
    "\n",
    "* This model synthesizes a bunch of noisy labeling functions into a set of (binary) supervised labels for examples. These labels are then used for __training__. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Thus, on this model, one need only have gold labels for assessment, thereby greatly reducing the burden of labeling examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The researchers open-sourced their code as [Snorkel](https://github.com/HazyResearch/snorkel). For ease of use and exploration, we'll work with a simplified version derived from [this excellent blog post](https://hazyresearch.github.io/snorkel/blog/dp_with_tf_blog_post.html). This is implemented in our course repository as `tf_snorkel_lite.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Project teams that find this direction useful are encouraged to use the real Snorkel, as it will better handle the complex relationships that inevitably arise in a set of real labeling functions."

    "\n",
    "1. __Supervised learning__: Individual examples _from the domain you care about_ labeled in a way that you think/assume/hope is aligned with your actual real-world objective. The model objective is to minimize error between predicted and actual.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Distantly supervised learning__: Exactly like supervised learning, but with individual examples _from a domain that is different from the one you care about_.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Semi-supervised learning__: A fundamentally supervised method that can make use of unlabeled data. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Reinforcement learning__: The data are in some sense labeled, but not at the level of individual examples. The model objective is essentially as in supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. __Unsupervised learning__: No labels that you can make use of directly. The model objective is thus set independently of the data but is presumably tied to something intuitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "In almost all domains right now, __effective learning is supervised learning__ – somewhere in 1–4. However, representations from unsupervised learning are very common as inputs to supervised deep learning models."

    "<br /><br />\n",
    "2. We write a set of $n$ labeling functions $\\Lambda$:\n",

    "<br /><br />\n",
    "4. We fit a generative model to $\\Lambda(T)$ that returns a binary vector $\\widehat{y}$ of length $m$. These are the labels for the examples in $T$ we'll use for __training__.\n",
    "<br /><br />\n",
    "5. From here, it's just supervised learning as usual. A feature function will map $T$ to a matrix of representations $X$, and you can pick your favorite supervised model. It will learn from $(X, \\widehat{y})$. In this way, you're doing supervised learning without any actual labeled data!"

As noted above, its primary limitation is that it makes the \"naive Bayes\" assumption that the labeling functions are independent.
